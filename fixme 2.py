'''
A program with errors.
The program should extract the sequence from a PDB file

Usage:

    fixme.py pdbfile

When corrected, the program will produce output like:

MET GLN ILE PHE VAL LYS THR LEU THR GLY LYS THR ILE THR LEU GLU VAL GLU PRO SER ASP THR ILE GLU ...

# The first six characters of each line in a PDB file show the kind of content
# At this point only the lines starting with 'ATOM' count.
# The ATOM lines have the following structure:

# The residue is in line[17:20]. Each residue has one c-alpha atom,
