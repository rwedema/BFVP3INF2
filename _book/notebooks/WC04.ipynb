    "* Functions with variable arguments lists (\\*args and \\*\\*kwargs)\n",
    "* Recursive functions\n",
    "* Functions as objects\n",
    "* Functions returning functions (closures)\n",

    "The aspects of functions named above are here demonstrated by making fractals, which are mathematical images with *scaled symmetry*: the image consists of smaller copies of itself, which consist of smaller copies of themselves. Such fractals actually occur in biological systems, and can be seen in the structures of weeds and trees. Nice examples are to be find <a href=\"http://paulbourke.net/fractals/fracintro/\">here</a>\n",
